POLITICAL CRISIS
Slogans
  The political slogans quoted in the November 1988 issue appeared in
each issue of The Working People's Daily throughout the month, as did
the "Noble Desire" slogan launched in February 1990.
      Since Apr. 7, 1989 the The Working People's Daily has run a
different political slogan across the bottom of each front page:
      June 1-5: There is no nobler, worthier or greater duty than
that of defending the independence of Myanmar Naing-Ngan so that it
shall not be lost.
      June 7: The three tasks of preventing the Union from
disintegrating, preventing disintegration of national unity and
perpetuating national sovereignty are essential for the perpetuation
of the indpendence of Myanmar Naing-Ngan.
      June 8-12: The Tatmadaw is the People's Tatmadaw which is
carrying out measures to ensure the Rule of Law in the country.
      June 13-17: Service personnel must stay clear of party politics
and dedicate themselves to dutifully carrying out State
responsibilities ÄÄthis amounts to carrying out national politics.
      June 18-24: Beware that the Myanmar situation today is no
longer that of 1947, 1962, 1974 or 1988; the situation now is that of
1990!
      June 25-28: The world situation is undergoing swift changes. We
should not lose sight of the fact that the Myanmar situation too is
changing swiftly!
      June 30: Love your nationality. Love your country. Preserve and
uphold your culture.
Political Articles (Excerpts)
      Following the pattern begun in October 1988, each issue
contains lengthy feature articles, translated from Burmese, designed
to bolster government views and policies.  We note them briefly, with
excerpts of particularly significant portions, but can provide copies
if needed:
      June 2: Myanmar culture which has fine traditions, by A health
worker. [Need to coordinate and fuse the monastic educational system
which "gives good moral education based on Buddhism" and the modern
system which "turns out modern educated persons well versed in the
sciences and the arts."]
      June 3: In solving the problems of internal peace by political
means, by Ye Gaung Kyaw Swa. [Cont. Abortive 1963 negotiations with
KIA.]
  June 11: The BCP has once again begun to commit atrocious and cruel
acts and carry out underground work, by A Reporter. [Article based on
confession of Kyaw Kyaw Tun, student tortured by the BCP.]
  June 12-15: The activities of KNU murderers and dacoits today, by A
Reporter. [(1) Victories over KNU; recent KNU atrocities. (2) More
atrocities. Bio-data on Bo Mya. (3-4) More KNU atrocities and
attacks.]
      June 20,24-25: The BBC still attacking Myanmar Naing-Ngan
spreading falsehood and lies, by Bo Thanmani. [(1) The BBC on June 4
said that "the delight felt by the people at the conclusion of the
election over three months ago has changed into disappointment and
dissatisfaction. This writing is an insult.... The Chairman of the
State {LORC} has declared...that State power would be handed over to
a strong government. The returns of the election are still being
announced and matters are being carried out according to the Election
Law.... All are happy and peaceful.... How can a government be formed
if there is not a suitable constitution in a nation? ... The
article...made false allegations...as if they were made by diplomats
from Western nations. `The diplomats from western nations in Yangon
say the State [LORC] is employing delay tactics.... [It] has got
wavering because even their own officers, by their votes, have
expressed overwhelmingly that they have no faith in it.' The writing
of this news article is of a very low standard."
      "Read the following broadcast by the BBC: `A considerable
number of personnel within the army are those that really believe
that they are the only force that has brilliant knowledge and
intelligence and that it only they who are able to serve the people
of Myanmar Naing-Ngan. A veteran western diplomat in Yangon said that
an officer had told him that it was because the people were so naive
that they had voted for the NLD.' ...It is inconceivable that
Tatmadaw officers should tell such things to western diplomats who
have such pessimistic views on and malicious attitudes towards
Myanmar Naing-Ngan...."
      "`Columnist Merry Marester has written an article in the
today's issue of Time to the effect that a western diplomat in Yangon
said that the NLD and the State {LORC} are like showing a "shadow"
plan and that the State {LORC} is trying hard and making calculations
on how to outwardly give up power.' The people ...will know that
this...attacks and slanders the State {LORC} as well as the NLD."
      (2) A BBC article by Pamela O'Toole said "...Gen. Saw Maung has
confirmed the fact that the army is determined to hold on to power
for some time although the National League for Democracy has won the
election. It can be seen that this also amounts to confirming the
view that the problem of drawing up a constitution would be raised so
that power would not have to be handed over earlier." In fact, Gen.
Saw Maung "has pointed out...that... everything was carried out
according to the Election Law and Rules whichever party had won the
election and that the Tatmadaw has no intention of delaying the
process.... What this Pamela has written shows that shge knows next
to nothing about the affairs of Myanmar Naing-Ngan."
      (3) She also wrote that delay indicated that "suspicions that
the military side will take measures to get some points included in
the constitution will become stronger.... All these will be aimed not
only at taking preventive measures so that no legal action can be
taken against their leaders, but also at laying down the foundation
for power for themselves." This writing is one that threatens the
Myanmar leaders. "It is very rude."]
      June 20: Burmese army and the `national interest', by Robert
Taylor {reproduced from the June 16, 1990 Bangkok Post.} [{Excerpts}
"First, despite the scepticism of critics, the army has fulfilled its
pledge to hold free and fair elections. And second, the voters have
clearly indicated their desire for change. The success of the
National League for Democracy (NLD) demonstrates that people are
unwilling to allow the military to continue to govern alone. Voting
for the NLD...was the surest way to register dissatisfaction with the
status quo.... Repeatedly since 1988 the military government has made
it clear it will not tolerate a government that would consider
lessening national cohesion .... Whatever happens, without compromise
and agreement between the army and the NLD leadership, the
restoration of civilian rule could be short-lived."
      "The army has also made it clear that it will not hand over
power... until a constitution has been written and approved.... The
government's policies since the 1988 coup have begun the process of
opening up Burma's economic system.... Foreign investment is again
possible and real economic growth could be rapid .... Might a
continuation of military rule while a constitution is being written,
actually be a blessing for the civilians who will eventually
follow?... Might not a civilian government have a better chance...if
the worst consequences of structural adjustment are over before it
assumes power?..."
      "The army...will continue to... retain supervisory role over
the political process until it is assured that the `national
interest,' as defined by the senior officer corps, is protected....
If one compares... Burma with other countries in the region...it
seems possible that a dialogue can result from elections and sharing
of power from that. But the process will not be quick or easy.
Evolutionary reform rather than quick fixes often results in more
lasting and positive democratic developments...."]
      June 25: A direct reply to the DAB insurgents organization by a
citizen of Myanmar, by Myan Pyi Thar. [Denunciation of DAB demand for
a role in the the constitutional process.]
      June 26-27: The life of absconding Myanmar youths in India, by
An India-returner. [(1-2) True confessions of a returnee.]
      June 28: The Dhamma and the Law (Thitsa-Myitta discussions), by
Byammahso. [Buddhist morality; "If an offense committed by a person
when he is a beggar gets uncovered at a time when he becomes a
minister, the offence cannot be dropped just because he happens to be
a minister."]
Press Conferences
      June 1: At the 93rd State LORC Press Conference, spokesmen
said:
      -- State LORC Chairman Senior General Saw Maung said on 30 May
that the election was free and fair, as journalists had seen, and
that "that they would never let the reoccurrence of situation as in
1988, that till the power has been handed over to a strong government
that would come into being in accordance with law, that they would
carry on implementing the first three tasks... [rule of law and
tranquillity; transportation; food, clothing and shelter] and that
they would always put in the fore the three main causes of non-
disintegration of the Union, non-disintegration of national
solidarity, and for perpetuation of national sovereignty."
      -- Asked what tasks the SLORC would carry out "before the next
government was formed...and how long they would take," the spokesman
said the SLORC would "carry on with the duties and responsibilities
till a strong government is formed according to the constitution and
that the SLORC would also continue to carry out the three main
tasks.... A constitution would be drawn up by the representatives of
the parties elected, that power would be handed over, according to
law, to the strong government formed in accordance with the
constitution thus drawn up and that it could not be said how long the
drafting of the constitution would take."
      -- Asked "whether the constitution thus drawn up would be put
to a referendum or not," the spokesman noted that the 1947
Constitution had not been put to a referendum, but that "it was
considered that good advice and suggestions as well as the desires of
the people including all the national races in connection with
drawing up a new constitution so as to bring out a strong new
constitution could be obtained and that it considered that the
people's representatives would take the advice, suggestions and
desires of the people into serious consideration and carry out.
[sic]"
      -- Asked "when would the State [LORC] and the representatives
of the political parties that won in the election meet?" the
spokesman said "there was no predetermination when such a meeting
would take place."
      -- "Asked "whether the political parties that had lost in the
election had the right to continue to exist or not?" the spokesman
said they could.
      -- Asked whether, since some 20 constituency results had been
announced each day, that figure had been decided on, the spokeman
said results were announced as soon as authentically ascertained,
without any specific quota. Tatmadaw helicopters were assisting, and
"whether the task of announcing the names could be finished within
the time estimated depended on weather conditions."
      -- Asked whether "the responsibilities would be handed over to
an interim government if such an interim government were formed with
the Hluttaw representatives while a constitution was being drawn up?"
the spokesman said "the State [LORC] would hand over the
responsibilities only to the strong government that would come into
being according to law in accordance with the Constitution drawn up
and approved by the Hluttaw representatives elected, and that this
was said not only now and that the State [LORC] Chairman and
Secretaries had told this time and time again...long before the
election was held."
      -- Asked whether action had been taken agaist anyone "for
security reasons" in connection with the election, the spokesman said
it had not.
      -- While most foreign election coverage was correct, some
broadcasts said "the election was not free and fair and that the
opposition had won and the party supported by the government had
lost." This was not true, since "our government is not a party
government but it is only a jury. So there is no opposition party to
us." The continued use of "opposition party" is inappropriate. (WPD
6/2)
      June 8:: At the 94th State LORC Press Conference, spokesmen
said:
      -- "There have been rumours that when a certain government
comes to power certain persons will take over certain positions and
such and such persons from certain departments will be dismissed or
imprisoned." This is false. "There will always be legal protection
for the service personnel who carry out their duties assigned
lawfully.... The State Law and Order Restoration Council will take
responsibility for the service personnel who have actively performed
their duties according to law. The State [LORC]...is the
Tatmadaw .... The service personnel, therefore, should not be
depressed or discouraged by rumours...."
      The spokesman said "the rumours are that the service personnel
serving with the present Government will be dismissed, that unsigned
letters have been sent that action will be taken against the judicial
officials ...and that the directors-general and the managing
directors will be dismissed."
      -- Clarification on the torturing by the BCP of the absconding
youth Kyaw Kyaw Tun (a) Min Thu, who escaped from the BCP.
"Photographs showing injuries in the buttock... caused by electric
shocks during investigation are not released since they are
indecent."
      -- Foreign radio has not criticized the BCP, though Chairman Ba
Thein Tin said in the videotaped Politburo meeting that it continued
to issue covert directives. Gen. Saw Maung's May 9 remarks on BCP
cited.
      -- The VOA and BBC said Thailand had handed over 1,000 Myanmar
refugees to Myanmar authorities. "The fact is that the Myanmar side
received altogether 766 persons.... It was according to the
Immigration Law of Thailand that they were sent back.... The 27
reception camps... are still kept open to receive those who wish to
return.... Insurgents... are being welcomed by us if they give up the
armed struggle and come back. The People's Settlement Central
Committee...has been formed to resettle them if they come back....
[It] was formed on 12 January 1990 ...to systematically carry out
resettlement and rehabilitation work ...for those who, realizing
their mistakes, come back to the legal fold as well as the villagers
who fled their villages because of dangers posed by the insurgents
and who have now come back." [Further details on Committee]
      -- Asked about numbers of refugees, the spokesman said they
"would not be able to know the number of those who had absconded and
that there are no refugees and there are none who asked for political
asylum."
      -- The spokesman had no comment on a statement by National
League for Democracy spokesman U Kyi Maung, made to "a correspondent
from a western nation at his house," that "preparations were being
made to form a civilian government."
      -- Asked when Universities would be reopened, the spokesman
said that "the Ministry of Education will announce in connection with
this matter when the time comes." (WPD 6/9)
      June 15: At the 95th State LORC Press Conference, spokesmen
said:
      -- Re announcements concerning election accounts and period for
raising objections to election results, the spokesman said "we have
heard some persons and some organizations criticize to the effect
that such issuing of announcements is aimed at causing delays without
any reason at all." They have either not read the Election Law and
Rules or "have evil intent to make the people misunderstand and
suspect the State [LORC] Government. [Text of relevant laws and
regulations reprinted.] The law is being followed.
      -- "93 parties contested the election. According to the
Commission announcements candidates of 23 parties have been elected
up to this day. But the number of elected representatives differs....
Since candidates of many political parties have been elected, a
single-party system has now come to an end.... The Tatmadaw
government...is no party organization. Therefore, it has no rival
party.... Hence, it has no opposition party before and after the
election. It will deal with all parties equally and perform its
duties in accordance with the law in future until the tasks are
accomplished."
      -- BCP UGs have been distributing illegal pamphlets in
Mandalay. "There are BCP UG cells and hardcores in Mandalay and
Monywa. Though BCPs are now weak in fighting they should not be
considered lightly."
      -- Asked about insurgent efforts to disrupt the election, the
spokesman said "there were signs of their attempts in some States but
in general there was no hindrance."
      -- Asked about reported "difficulties in obtaining school books
and stationery," since schools reopened, the spokesman said "those
concerned have been supplying the students with the required books
and stationery." (WPD 6/16)
      June 22: At the 96th State LORC Press Conference, spokesmen
said:
      -- A video show was shown "on the holding of the June 11-14
meeting of the Democratic Alliance of Burma (DAB) headed by KNU Bo
Mya." The DAB rejected the 1947 unitary constitution, and said the
KIA would be come the security forces of Kachin State and the KNU of
Kayin State. "They would hold negotiations for ceasefire only when
their desire for the emergence of federalism was fulfilled." Numerous
foreign news stories cited. The KNU are "living in safety and sending
the children into the jaws of death," and "the plot of KNU Bo Mya to
assassinate foreigners clearly indicates their ruthless terrorist
policy." [Photocopies of various foreign news stories.] [More photos
on 6/24]
      -- "Arrangements have been made" according to law for meeting
with parties and holding a Hluttaw session to draw up a constitution,
and will be announced when the time comes.
      -- Asked about reports that signboards of the League for
Democracy and Peace "were put down", the spokesman said he had heard
that the party had split into two [see below under Elections].
      -- Before the disturbances there were about 4,000 KNU. Now,
after the capture of 6 camps and the loss of 1,000, "there are about
2000 including young ones." (WPD 6/23)
      June 29: At the 97th State LORC Press Conference, spokesmen
said:
      -- The Army on June 19-20 seized 50 packets of opium weighing
96 viss, 30 ticals, from insurgents from an opium caravan north of
the Mongping/Kengtung motor road, and in an ambush near Hparchan
junction in Namhkam Twp. 8 insurgents were killed; 2 Tatmadawmen died
and 1 was wounded. 32.5 kilos of heroin were seized at the Manhkan
Village checkpoint in Namtu Twp. on June 19.
      -- Attacks on timber smugglers in Myawady Twp. near the Thai-
Myanmar border on June 24-28 captured 125 Thai nationals and 25
Myanmars, along with 3 saw mills, 9 vehicles, an elephant, arms and
ammunition, etc. [details given]. The Thais are being detained in
Myanmar "for the time being." [map].
      -- The Bangkok Post of June 27 notes Thai seizure of arms from
"three Myanmar-Muslims" in Thon Buri, across from Bangkok, at a house
"reportedly rented to a Pakistani airplane pilot about nine months
ago."
      -- BCP Central Committee member Sai Aung Win surrendered at
Lashio on June 29. Born in Loilem in 1937 he went underground in
1962, became Shan State southern district BCP committee member in
1966; candidate Central Committee member in 1975; and Central
Committee member in 1985. After he "decided to return to the legal
fold" he resigned from the BCP on Mar. 3, 1990. [photo]
      -- The spokesman declined comment on a reported statement by
Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister U Ohn Gyaw that "a new Hluttaw could
not be held before September." (WPD 6/30)
Post-Election Briefings
      May 31: Minister for Health and for Education Col. Pe Thein
reminded Ministry employees that "they are not party members. They
needn't change their attitude depending upon the political parties'
win or loss in the election." They should continue to be "obedient to
their superiors," since "they were obliged to conscientiously perform
their duties irrespective of whichever government comes to power."
(WPD 6/1)
      June 2: Visiting Shwepaukkan new town, State LORC Secretary (2)
Maj-Gen. Tin Oo said that "the constitution to be drawn up needed to
become one which the people accepted." [According to headlines over
the article, "It cannot be assumed that our duties are completed
though the election has been held./New Constitution is to be drawn up
and enacted; Our construction activities and special projects are to
be carried out out with momentum till a government is formed under
new constitution./Constitution concerns not only a party or a group
but also the people of entire nation and thus it must be the one
accepted by the entire national people."] (WPD 6/3)
      June 7: Minister for Health and for Education and Chief
Commanding Officer of the University Training Corps Col. Pe Thein
told education officers: "You are all aware that the country has seen
a drastic change. The SLORC has accomplished the four main tasks but
it will carry on its duty of further implementing the first three
tasks until a new government emerges in accordance with the law.
Transition of power will be made only then.... I would like to say as
regarding a national concern. This is paying respect to the State
flag.... You teachers are to instil in your pupils the spirit of
paying respect and reference to the State flag. Similarly, your
pupils are required to be taught the singing of the National Anthem."
Basic education schools will reopen June 11. (WPD 6/8)
      June 17: Speaking to officials in Kungyangonn and Twantay Twps.
[Yangon], State LORC Secretary (1) Maj-Gen. Khin Nyunt said:
      "Although the election has been held we will continue to carry
out the regional development work. It is heard that some diplomats
from certain foreign embassies in Yangon secretly met persons from
certain parties and some youths in breach of their diplomatic ethics
and instigated them. I would like to make known this to the people."
(WPD 6/18)
      June 20: State LORC Secretary (2) Maj-Gen. Tin Oo told local
officials that: "Having held the freest and fairest election, we have
proved that Tatmadaw is not power crazy. And we have time and again
declared that power will be transferred only to the strong government
that will be formed according to law." (WPD 6/21)
Saboteurs' Confessions
      May 31: Confession of Aung Naing, a ABSDF insurgent, revealing
his background, training, contacts with other insurgents, and
sabotage plans. [Photos of 4 others implicated.] (WPD 6/1)
      June 4: SSA student Maung Kyaw Kyaw Tun (a) Min Thu tells of
arrests and torture at the BCP Central Headquarters at Panghsang in
1989. (WPD 6/5)
Don't Hurry the Constitution
      June 8: Careful thought required. "`Don't expect fresh, potable
water on the same day the well is dug....' It is all too easy to rush
into things with perhaps the well-intentioned urge to get things done
quickly. It is also all too easy for haste to result in dislocations,
confusion and chaos. If not immediately, then in some later date when
the inherent built-in weaknesses of a badly thought-out course of
action bring about a backlash which could have been avoided.... The
constitution of a nation which aspires to be democratic concerns not
only a political party or a group of political parties; it concerns
all the peoples of the entire nation and as such it must be
acceptable to all the national peoples. And as such, the framing of a
constitution is a classic case in which all factors which are likely
to impinge upon national welfare as a whole ought to be carefully
considered and thought out. Getting it done as quickly as possible is
certainly not the be-all and end-all of the business at hand." (WPD
editorial 6/8)
      June 22: What is to be done? "... there is all the time in the
world to sculpt a constitution comprehensive enough and strong enough
to give force to the aspirations of the entire nation. `Instant
constitutions' are certainly not the answer. What is to be done today
is to put aside emotion-ridden partisan inclinations and get down to
the serious business of putting together a constitution based upon
the three essential ingredients of preventing the disintegration of
the Union, preserving national unity and maintaining national
sovereignty for all time." (WPD editorial 6/22)
Refugee Resettlement
      June 14: Minister for Livestock Breeding & Fisheries and for
Agriculture & Forests Lt-Gen. Chit Swe told Bago Division officials
that the Cabinet had on Jan. 12, 1990 reconstituted the Manpower
Resettlement and Utilization Board, of which he is Chairman, to help
"ease the food, clothing and shelter difficulties of the returnees as
well as for rehabilitating them.... It is common knowledge that peace
and tranquillity has been restored in the entire nation.... Those who
have trod on the wrong path have now returned to live together as
they have come to realize the goodwill and attitude of the government
towards them. And we are all honoured to do the noble task of
providing all assistance to our brethren who have returned to join us
in carrying out nation-building tasks and development activities as
well as to those who left their native villages for fear of the
insurgents and now returned to their homes."  (WPD 6/15)
      June 16: The Minister said in Mawlamyine that resettlement
programmes in Kayin and Mon States would provide for each family K
3000 of agricultural inputs, K 3000 of animal feedstuff, medicines
and inputs for livestock breeding, and K 2000 worth of assistance. To
help them rebuild villages, K 7000 of building materials would be
furnished, all free of charge. K 13.39 million would be used for this
in fiscal 1990-91. "Those to be resettled should be free to choose
either the highlands or the plains in conformity with their
traditions and customs." (WPD 6/17)
Gen. Saw Maung's Speech
      June 18: Addressing the fourth coordinating meeting between the
State LORC and the Committee for Compiling Authentic Facts on Myanmar
History, State LORC Chairman Senior General Saw Maung made the
following principal points [text published]:
      -- The publications of the Committee clarify various episodes
from 1947, notably that the 1947 Constitution was framed and adopted
"according to the will of the British" before independence and
therefore included a right of secession.
      -- The Revolutionary Council came into being "because of the
right to secede contained in that Constitution." It was "a legal
government."
      -- The State LORC Government "is also a legal government." It
is not bound by any constitution. "I would like to emphasize that a
sound constitution is essential in order that there may not be
problems in future."
      -- The insurgents threaten further attacks "if the military
government is not forthright concerning the election returns...."
There "is no cause for us to be bothered by the likes of these
insurgents.... It is enough to say they have now got only two
camps...Manepalaw and New Wankha left...."
      -- "We will not accept any attempt to return to the 1988
incidents. We are prepared to face any eventuality.... It must be
noted that constitution is the concern of all the citizens including
us, the Tatmadaw members and the service personnel. We will do what
needs to be done ...." (WPD 6/19)
ELECTIONS
Election Returns
      The following are Constituency election returns. Tables
published in the WPD include the number of eligible voters, votes
cast, valid votes cast, the valid votes cast and percentages for each
candidate, and the winner. We list this data as follows:
      Constituency (State/Division)
      Voters; Votes Cast; Valid Votes; Number of candidates
      Name ("U" omitted; all military titles should be read as
"retired"); Party (by initials--see table at end for full names and
No.); Votes received; Percent.
      Note: It is not practicable to provide information for all
candidates. We have tallied the votes only for candidates receiving
more than 10% of the valid votes, and for NLD and NUP candidates in
any case. Where the NLD, or the NUP, did not run a candidate, this is
indicated. The PUO, YUO, and WUO are allied with the NUP, which did
not run candidates against them, and in some areas the NLD did not
run against allied ethnic regional parties.
